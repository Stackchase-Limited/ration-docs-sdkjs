# Ration Docs - sdkjs

The editor engine in JavaScript: the document, spreadsheet and presentation models, their layout and their formula engine.

Part of **[Ration Docs Desktop](https://github.com/Stackchase-Limited/ration-docs-desktop)**, an offline office suite maintained by Stackchase Limited. This repository is a modified version of [ONLYOFFICE/sdkjs](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/sdkjs), originally developed by Ascensio System SIA, forked at release 9.4.0.

## What lives here

`word/`, `cell/`, `slide/` and `pdf/` hold the editing logic for each document
type - the model, the layout, the undo stack, the formula evaluator. This is where
editing behaviour is fixed, as opposed to the interface around it, which is
`web-apps`.

## Building

This repository is not built on its own. It is one submodule of the suite, and
`build_tools` drives the whole build:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Stackchase-Limited/ration-docs-desktop.git
    cd ration-docs-desktop/build_tools
    python3 configure.py --module desktop --platform linux_arm64 --qt-dir /usr
    python3 make.py
